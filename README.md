# gamesboard
The complete android client and web server tier for my multi-game application https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pigdroid.gameboard

It runs board games, has kind-of a hierarchy able to implement presentation independent board games of various kinds. 

Feel free to update this thing or get involved if you want. Ask me whatever because I would love this to keep going and growing.

User friend/contact system is still primitive and some errors bugs are around in the Android client.
